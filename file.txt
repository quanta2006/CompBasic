Learning to say NO 



Refusing favors is a part of life.

We've all been taught that we should help people.It is the right thing to do And will make us popular with others.

It may even win us favors in return.

However, we must be realistic.We can't say yes to every request.
If we did, we would fail or go crazy for sure.

Sometimes we simply don't have time to help.In this case, we must know how to say no politely.

Saying NO can be very difficult.

People with low self-esteem very often have a lack of assertiveness think they have to meet the expectations of everyone.

It is very difficult for them to set limits with others.

They sometimes feel ashamed or even guilty if they would say NO.

However it is also difficult to against your will. ]

A simple and direct "NO, I am not able to help you with that" is the best solution.

Have to give an explanation you should keep it simple:¡± NO, I have already made an another appointment for this time" or "NO, sorry. I am afraid I have to decline because I have no spare time." 





You can try to use an empathic NO, if you would have helped under different circumstances: 

For example, if someone ask you to take care of his cat you may refuse like this

"Sorry, no. I would have kept your cat next weekend.But I will be off for visit.

I know it will be hard to find someone to take care off the cat.
I will try to help you next time." 

We must not feel guilty about saying no.

Sometimes refusing others is the right thing to do.It can save ourselves, and them, a lot of trouble.

In short, we cannot please everyone all the time.
